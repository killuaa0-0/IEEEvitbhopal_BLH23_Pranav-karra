PROJECT TITLE : EMPOWERMENT OF DISABLED INDIVIDUALS

TEAM NAME  : Pranav Karra

Project Description : 
      On our planet there are almost 285 million visually imparted people and few of them are blind who cannot see the real world we are living in , they face alot of problems in their day to day life , one of the major problem that blind people face is they cannot detect if an object is coming in their way or not which leads to injuries and some of them could be major. To end this problem my team has decided to make a device that can be fitted in any place (for example specs, hat , stick etc..)  which notifies the person when an object comes in his / her way. Like this a person who cant see will know whether the path he/she is going in safe or not.

TECHNOLOGY USED :

HARDWARE :  SENSORS , CAMERA , SPEAKER (for audio alert)
SOFTWARE :  programming languages (python , cpp ) , numpy , cv2 , pretrained tenserflow ml model (mobile net ssd)

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS : 
           the chip manufactured and programmed for the project will be connected to sensors and camera which help to detect and object when it is in radius of 10 metres

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS :
           attach it to any of the accesories which you were (glasses , hat etc..) which can give the camera a wide view 

THEME FIT :
       blind people face many difficulties in their day to day life one of the major problem they face is collide with objects which they cannot see , by this project we help them to identify whether there is an object in the way they are going in around 10meteres radius with this they can be more confident while they will also be aware whether there is an object in their surroundings or not
   

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS :
          for future enhancements you can add a voice assistant in the device so it can tell which side the obstacle is and notify us through a voice assistant in the language the user understands.
